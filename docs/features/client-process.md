# Client Process
Client is guided through a wizard-like interface, each page collects some information of the client and redirects the client to the next.

| Step | Title | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Details | Collect client information [Name, Address, Policy Name(s), Account Number(s)] |
| 2. | Forms | Download pre-filled third-party-consent form, sign, upload |
| 3. | Identification | Upload photo identification of client |
| 4. | Done | Allow client to sign-out or go back to previous steps |

This process is detailed more clearly in the sequence diagram below:
